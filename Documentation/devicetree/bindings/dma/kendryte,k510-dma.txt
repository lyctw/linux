* Kendryte K510 System DMA Controller

Required properties:
- compatible: "Canaan,k510-sysdma"
- reg: Address range of the DMAC registers. Should contain the registers base address and length
- clocks: Should contain a reference to the parent clock
- interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
- interrupts: 
- dma-channels: Number of DMA channels supported by the controller. The maximum value is 4.

Example:

    sysdma: dma-controller@93050000 {
        compatible = "Canaan,k510-sysdma";
        reg = <0x0 0x93050000 0x0 0x10000>;
        clocks = <&refclk>;
        interrupt-parent = <&plic0>;
        interrupts = <30 4>;
        dma-channels = <4>;
    };

* Kendryte K510 Peripherals DMA Controller

Required properties:
- compatible: "Canaan,k510-peridma"
- reg: Address range of the DMAC registers. Should contain the registers base address and length 
- dma-cells: Should be 4. For more details, please refer to the DMA client binding below
- clocks: Should contain a reference to the parent clock   
- interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle for the interrupt controller 
- interrupts: 
- dma-channels: Number of DMA channels supported by the controller. The maximum value is 16
- dma-requests: Number of DMA request signals supported by the controller

Example:
	
    peridma: dma-controller@93040000 {
        compatible = "Canaan,k510-peridma";
        reg = <0x0 0x93040000 0x0 0x10000>;
        #dma-cells = <4>;
        clocks = <&refclk>;
        interrupt-parent = <&plic0>;
        interrupts = <31 4>;
        dma-channels = <16>;
        dma-requests = <35>;
    };

* Clients

DMA clients connected to the Kendryte Peripherals DMA controller must use the format described in
the dma.txt file, using a five-cell specifier for each channel.
The five cells in order are:

1. A phandle pointing to the DMA controller
2. The priority of the dma channel. The valid value can be 1 to 15.
3. Channel response waiting timeout time.
4. Data endian configuration. 
   0x0: Default configuration without any adjustment 
   0x1: The transmission length is two bytes, and endian conversions are performed.
   0x2: The transmission length is four bytes, and endian conversions are performed.  
   0x3: The transmission length is eight bytes, and endian conversions are performed.  
5. Choose peripherals.

Example:

	sha256: sha256-controller@91010000 {
        compatible = "kendryte,k510-sha256";
        reg = <0x0 0x91010000 0x0 0x10000>;
        clocks = <&refclk>;
        status = "okay";
        dmas = <&peridma 1 0xfff 0 0x20>;
        dma-names = "tx";
    };
